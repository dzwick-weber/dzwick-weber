The basic idea for both is very simple - you move along a sequence of squares by either drawing cards or rolling dice, and the goal is to get to the end of the sequence. It's a race, but there's no strategy involved - whether you win or lose is entirely up to the luck of either the draw or the roll. It's good for little children, and it teaches them to follow directions and pay attention, but its appeal is limited because it's not possible to get \"good\" at playing the game."
